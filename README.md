# COVID-19 SQL Queries for Tableau Visualization

This repository contains the SQL queries I created while analyzing global COVID-19 data for a Tableau dashboard project. The queries were designed to explore infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress across countries and regions.

## Contents

- **CovidQueries.sql** â€“ All queries written during the project, fully commented.
  - The **first four queries** were used directly in Tableau to generate visuals.
  - Additional queries are included for deeper exploration, validation, and future analysis.

## Key Features

- Aggregates and summarizes case and death data across countries and continents.
- Calculates death percentages, highest infection counts, and percentage of population infected.
- Joins COVID deaths and vaccination data for tracking vaccination progress.
- Includes exploratory queries beyond what was visualized in Tableau, kept for transparency and future use.

## Project Goal

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how SQL can be used to transform and prepare raw COVID-19 data for visualization in Tableau. By filtering, aggregating, and joining datasets, I created insights that could then be communicated through interactive dashboards.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server** for writing and running queries  
- **Tableau** for building the visualizations  
- **COVID-19 datasets** (cases, deaths, and vaccinations)

This repository showcases how SQL analysis and Tableau visualization work hand-in-hand to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
